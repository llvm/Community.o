### [Engineering Manager, Apple Silicon GPU Compiler Backend](mailto:devtools-job-apply@group.apple.com)

The Apple Silicon GPU Compiler Backend team is seeking a results-oriented engineering manager to lead a team focused on high performance GPU codegen. The team focuses on Apple Silicon for many different devices (including iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Mac), products used by over a billion customers worldwide. We work with many different organizations within Apple – platform architecture, silicon engineering, GPU device drivers, Xcode, frameworks, and developer tools. This kind of collaboration and cross-functional reach allows the team to influence processor architecture and results in delivering great performance, functionality and robustness. We are focused on improving the user experience by maximizing the execution speed of the code generated for Apple’s GPUs, while minimizing energy consumption. We are enabling new GPU architectures, graphics and GPU-compute features, and applications through innovation in compilers. At Apple, great ideas have a way of becoming great products, services, and customer experiences very quickly. Imagine what you could do here.

The Debugger Compiler Integration team at Apple is looking for an engineer to work on debug info the compiler and/or language support in the debugger. You will take a holistic look at what matters for developers, such as supporting new language features in the debugger, improving the accuracy of debug info for optimized code, or improving common debugging workflows. You will get to work closely with the the open source community on llvm.org and swift.org where you will become a regular contributor.

### [Swift Compiler and Tools Engineer](https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200217394/swift-compiler-and-tools-engineer)

This position offers the rare opportunity to build tools that will be used by the millions of developers writing code for Apple platforms and server-side Swift! And the opportunity to inspire changes across our developer tools. Our team's projects include components of the Swift compiler, Swift's SourceKit, SourceKit-LSP, SwiftSyntax, and Xcode IDE's source languages support service.

### [C++ Standard Library Engineer](https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200208819/c-standard-library-engineer)

We're looking for an engineer to participate in the development and maintenance of Libc++ as well as complementary changes to Clang. You will drive the implementation of new C++ features, evaluate and optimize existing components of the library, and work with teams across Apple to take advantage of these improvements. You will be an active contributor to the llvm.org (http://llvm.org/) open source project and collaborate with the open source community.

### [LLVM Compiler Engineer](devtools-job-apply@group.apple.com)

The CPU and Accelerator Compilers team at Apple is looking for an engineer to work on optimizations in the LLVM compiler. You will drive analysis of performance sensitive code, implement new optimizations, and evaluate their performance impact. You will collaborate with our partners in hardware and software organizations. You will be an active contributor to the llvm.org open source project.

### [Swift Language Runtime Engineer](https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200206374/swift-language-runtime-engineer?team=SFTWR)

The Swift Language Runtime library provides core functionality required by all Swift programs at runtime. As a Swift Runtime Engineer, you'll be responsible for ensuring this critical component runs efficiently on all CPU architectures and OS platforms supported by the Swift Programming Language. You'll collaborate closely with compiler engineers to ensure that the compiler's expectations match the runtime behavior. And you'll do the bulk of this work directly in the Swift Open Source Project on Github.
