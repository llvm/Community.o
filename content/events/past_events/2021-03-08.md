This 3-day virtual event was an inclusive space for underrepresented groups and newcomers, anywhere in their career, interested in learning and contributing to compilers, tools, and programming languages. Members from different open source communities making incredible efforts to support a thriving environment were highlighted. Summit attendees experienced interesting talks, panels, workshops, and networked amongst everyone who could attend.

While many of the sessions were not recorded, you may find various talks available through the LLVM Youtube.
