The LLVM Women in Compilers and Tools Meetup Series is a free virtual event
 held once every month. It is a platform where all women
 (trans, non-binary, and cis) in various stages
 in their career, speak openly, discuss, and network with others. This
 series will feature talks, tutorials, mentoring events and regularly
 highlights individuals for their contributions to the compiler,
 programming languages, and tools field and offers
 continued discussions concluding each event.

This series is organized by The Women in Compilers and Tools (WiCT) working group.
This working group is composed of volunteers in the LLVM community
 and supported by the LLVM Foundation.
