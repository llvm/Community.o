Rebecca Swords has industry experience in full stack appliation development and program synthesis research. She currently engages in research in her spare time as a stay-at-home mother. In this talk, Rebecca presented an overview of E-graphs, which is a data structure with applications in term extraction. She explored how E-graphs propose different techniques than traditional compilers for applying large sets of rewriting rules. She also taught the audience about E-graphs in the context of [Quiche](https://github.com/riswords/quiche/blob/main/demo/arithmetic_demo.py), the project she develops for implementing E-graphs in Python with specialized support for Python AST rewriting.
