In this meetup, the organizers hosted the first **in-person** event! This event was held in the local Bay Area with many women across the professional compiler industry. There was also an opportunity to share with the community the future goals and plans for the meetup series and gather feedback that others would like to see and participate in for WiCT. We also learned the motivations and how attendees learned about the group and started engaging in hopes to continue to grow the environment that makes up the Women in Compilers & Tools Community Group!
