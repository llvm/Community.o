Sangeeta shared an overview of her thesis research to detect and resolve floating point computation errors. These kinds of issues can influence program output, as well as, program control flow. She described approaches in resolving such errors by employing shadow analysis with real numbers to comprehensively detect numerical errors. This approach has been explored in the past but had high overheads making it unusable with long-running applications. Sangeeta shared the reasoning behind the high cost of detection and ideas that can result in a speedup of error detection and debugging by a significant factor over the current state-of-the-art.
