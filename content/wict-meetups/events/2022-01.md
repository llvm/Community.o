 Anna is a Senior Community Program Manager at Github and active volunteer across many different open source communities related to the Python Programming Language. With a background as an effective community builder, mentor, teacher, and student, we explored the insights she's cultivated throughout her career. Anna shared her journey getting started as a python contributor to becoming an active member. We also discussed her journey in mental health and how advocating for mental health in the technology space has impacted her career and the communities she takes part in.
