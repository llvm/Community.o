This talk provided a great overview of instruction selection and the exisiting functionality within LLVM with a deeper focus on [GlobalISel](https://llvm.org/docs/GlobalISel/index.html). Jessica detailed tooling that was designed to find and understand performance and compile time gaps between the FastISel/SelectionDAG infrastructure and GlobalISel. She provided insight into how GlobalISel's design has improved upon the performance, code size, and compile time of the previous instruction selection frameworks.
