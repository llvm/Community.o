In this meetup, the WiCT organizers hosted a trivia game to highlight the history of LLVM, compilers & related tooling, programming languages, and much more. This was a fun opportunity to test your knowledge on dragons, overloaded terminology and what really came first... a compiler or interpreter. 
Folks joined this trivia challenge with a randomized team of 4-6 individuals and each team had the opportunity to win LLVM merchandise!
