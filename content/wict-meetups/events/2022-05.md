Michelle Strout is the manager for the [Chapel Parallel Computing Programming Language](https://chapel-lang.org) at Hewlett Packard Enterprise and a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Arizona. In this meetup we explored the journey through her education and career which spans from her undergraduate and PH.D. at University of San Diego to her postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory. The audience asked her about their own academic goals and how she has managed a thriving career while prioritizing her personal life and family.
