Angélica is a PhD Candidate at Federal University of Minas Gerais as well as a Research Intern at Microsoft Research. She gave an insightful overview of software based static profiling and its applications. She introduced concepts like static prediction using heuristics and ML. She also detailed [The VESPA Project](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485521), which is a static branch predictor built on top of BOLT that her research focuses on.
