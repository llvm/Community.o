Theresa leads the development of the Slang Compiler project at NVIDIA. The [Slang Shading language and compiler](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang) extends the widely used HLSL shading language with the necessary mechanisms from modern general-purpose languages like Rust and Swift to allow developers to write clean and modular rendering code while still achieving the best possible performance on GPU hardware. This talk focused on the journey of developing Slang, which started with research insights in language design and implementation to carry them all the way through to production reality.
